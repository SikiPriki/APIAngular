# API Angular
This code is made with angular and it gets data from an API and then shows it as a table. When one howers on specfic row then the text becomes bolder and the other rows become shadowy so it's more easy to consentrate on the row one looks at.

## Development server

First go to the angular map (`cd angular`) thrn run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
